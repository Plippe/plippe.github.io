# Documentation Driven Development 
Test-driven development is a way of writing code. Tests are written first allowing the author to focus on the expected results instead of the implementation. 

On paper, the premise makes sense, but the concept is controversial. It mostly boils down to a time versus quality argument. Something I won't comment on right now. On another hand, I would like to introduce the idea of Documentation Driven Development or DDD.

Can writing documentation first help to release better code?

# Releasing code
Working in a team is hard. Everyone has different habits. This often results in projects that have multiple personalities. Some tools help reduce friction, but not everything can be automated.

To limit conflicts and keep the quality hight, teams often agree on a definition of done. This "contract" contains requirements that must be met before the work can be released. 

They range from coding styles, test coverage, documentationpercentage, for a piece of work can be marked as finished.
